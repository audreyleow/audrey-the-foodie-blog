excerpt: "Sichuan food spots are a dime a dozen in SG, and you might be a bit dissuaded by the gimmicky nature of this space-themed restaurant. But I'm here to tell you not to judge a book by its cover! We had an absolutely delicious meal here!"

{frontmatter.excerpt} We started with their 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡 𝐆𝐨𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐬 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐩 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐞 and were delighted by the generous portions of thick fish slices were fatty and so tender! Not forgetting the wonderfully savoury broth served in an adorable heart-shaped pot - we got their Signature Vine Pepper Pot Base (小懒)!

The next thing that got our attention were these 𝐆𝐫𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐌𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐢𝐛𝐬 that were plated with an adorable astronaut sitting on the side of a crescent moon! Awesome thematic presentation aside, these were well-seasoned, tender and perfectly cooked! A must order if you enjoy gamey meat like we do!

Sichuan food isn't complete without ordering some 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐒𝐤𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐬. We tried their beef, roast pork and chicken skewers. Our favourites were the fatty pork and the savoury chicken that were unexpectedly tender!

Something that was a little ususual for us were these 𝐁𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐃𝐮𝐜𝐤 𝐅𝐞𝐞𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡 𝐏𝐞𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐫! I have never tried these before and was a bit uncertain. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this dish! If you love munching on cartilage like me, you will love this like I do! This was soo numbing too!

If you aren't too adventurous with your tastebuds like my hubs, you can always get their 𝐓𝐞𝐩𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐚𝐤𝐢 𝐒𝐨𝐟𝐭 𝐓𝐨𝐟𝐮. It was wonderfully savoury - we loved the crunch of the minced meat and onions! You can't go wrong with this combination!
