{excerpt} and this 𝐌𝐨𝐦𝐨 𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐭 [$9] is no exception!

I loved how the fruitiness of the peach puree and the earthiness of the sencha are a perfect blend without being too sweet! The tart raspberry coated rice ball bits were a nice touch too! That being said, the weakness of this dessert was its base. It’s made from nuts and cranberries - kinda like a soft oatmeal cookie crossed with a biscotti type of flavour. Not the biggest fan of that lao-hong texture - would have preferred an almond flour crust instead!
