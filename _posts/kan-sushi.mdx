{excerpt} If you love trying different varieties of fish, the 15pc 𝐎𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐒𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐢 𝐋𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡 [$118] is perfect for you! That being said, the sushi rice is on the less vinegary side. You can choose 9,12 or 15 pieces of sushi and this set comes with miso soup, salad and a soup! For just $60, you can enjoy a 9pc omakase sushi lunch! Truly unbeatable value at Kan Sushi!

| 𝐏𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐥𝐞𝐬                | Now, I know pickles aren't sushi ofc. Regardless, these were sweet,salty, tangy and crunchy! I enjoyed the sake-soaked pickle that had a complex bitter intensity that complemented the saltiness! |

The strength in this omakase meal were the fishes. Not only was it exciting to try so many different varieties of fishes, the sushi themselves allowed the natural flavours of the fishes to shine. Coupled with the great value for money of Kan Sushi's Lunch omakase options , this is definitely an omakase spot I will be returning to!
