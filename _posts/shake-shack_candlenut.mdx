This 𝐁𝐮𝐚𝐡 𝐊𝐞𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐤 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐫 [$12.90] was the star of the show! I loved the spicy and peppery flavours of buah keluak glaze and the chicken curry sauce, the smoky patty with its delicious charred edges and the gentle tang of the crunchy pickles. Not forgetting the creamy yolk that balanced the warm heat. I also picked up on some sweetness from the ikan bilis sambal. Most burgers get boring half-way for me but this one was solidly moreish. If this comes back again, I’d recommend y’all to give it a shot at least once.

I also got their 𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 [$5.20] - every single fry was crispy and I found the earthy curry powder to be very enjoyable. That being said, the seasoning was quite bare-bones and on the sparse side so some salt was needed.
