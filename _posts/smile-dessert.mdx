{excerpt} These 𝐓𝐢𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐮 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 [$15.90] pancakes were so fluffy! I liked the coffee flavour of the tiramisu. The ice cream was sweet and milky too!

The 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐢 𝐒𝐭𝐲𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐈𝐜𝐞 [$16.90] had a nice earthy tea flavour, albeit on the less strong side. I liked the coconut flavours of the crunchy granola and the slightly savoury cream on top! Btw this was HUGE, good for sharing amongst 4 ppl!

We got their 𝐌𝐢𝐱𝐞𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐚 [$7.90] and their 𝐃𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐨𝐧 𝐅𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐚 [$7.90]. The mixed fruit tea was citrusy and refreshing, while the latter was sweet with a plum-like fragrance!
