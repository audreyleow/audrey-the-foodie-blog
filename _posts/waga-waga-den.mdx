{excerpt} What stands out about 👌🏼𝐂𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐧 [$9] is its lovely cocoa flavours that blend perfectly with the creamy milk. The sweetness only comes from the chocolate syrup at the bottom, making this a very balanced and smooth iced chocolate when you stir it!

The price tag on this iced chocolate is definitely on the high side tho.
