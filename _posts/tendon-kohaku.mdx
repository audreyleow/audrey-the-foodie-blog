{excerpt} We got their 𝐊𝐨𝐡𝐚𝐤𝐮 𝐓𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐭 [$17.80] and despite how it looks, the batter of every ingredient with light without any oily heaviness! We particularly enjoyed the savouriness of the original sauce - if you like some heat, you can also choose either spicy or mala sauce! The proteins like their prawn, squid and chicken breast were nicely cooked with a good bouncy texture! The veggies like their french beans, pumpkin and baby corn were light - you can really taste the natural fresh flavours of veggies!

This came with a side of chawanmushi and miso soup that were pretty forgettable. We added their 𝐇𝐚𝐥𝐟 𝐁𝐨𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐄𝐠𝐠 𝐓𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐚 [$2] as a side - unfortunately it wasn’t very good. Tempura Makino does it best!
