{excerpt} You can opt for add-on Amuse Bouche [+$8], I got their 𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐇𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢 𝐂𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐞 which was tangy and wonderfully savoury! There's also a vegetarian option available!

If you prefer a summarised version of my experience, scroll ahead down. Otherwise, here's a detailed breakdown of what we got:

| Savouries                            | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👌🏻 𝐃𝐮𝐜𝐤 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐭 𝐒𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐰𝐢𝐜𝐡              | The duck confit was rich and flavourful! while the mustard had a nice tang!                                                                        |
| 𝐎𝐜𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐒𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐰𝐢𝐜𝐡                 | This was pretty basic, the sweet citrus mascarpone was a bit off-putting and didn't pair very well with the brininess of ocean trout and trout roe |
| 👌🏼 𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐒𝐰𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐛 𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐜𝐡𝐞         | This was very enjoyable - I loved the sweetness and brininess of the swimmer crab!                                                                 |
| 𝐓𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐧 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐢                 | Nicely toasted with a sweet prawn mixture topping but nothing spectacular                                                                          |
| 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞-𝐅𝐞𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞 | Fragrant truffle flavour for a forgettable earthy quiche                                                                                           |

| Sweets                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 𝐑𝐚𝐬𝐩𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐢𝐬 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐤 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐭 | Milk chocolate is perfect for the sweet tooth!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 𝐇𝐚𝐳𝐞𝐥𝐧𝐮𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐭                    | It tasted like ferrero roche in a dessert form!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐢𝐬 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐧𝐮𝐭 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐥              | This had a strong earthiness that wasn’t my thing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 👌🏼 𝐆𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝟕𝟎% 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐮𝐞𝐱   | The chocolate was smooth and paired nicely with the citrusy flavours of the orange!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐕𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐱 𝐏𝐮𝐟𝐟 | I enjoyed how creamy and fragrant the vanilla cream was!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 𝐁𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐧                         | This had an interesting raspberry-like sweetness!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 👌🏼 𝐂𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐞 𝐁𝐨𝐧𝐛𝐨𝐧                         | Lovely bitter-sweetness of the smooth coffee ganache!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐫 𝐕𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬      | I don’t recall their scones being like this my previous visit but it was leaning towards the consistency of a biscuit, with a butteriness that was predominantly on the top half of the scone. Nonetheless, I loved the tartness of the lemon butter curd, milkiness of the clotted cream but I personally found the strawberry marmalade too sweet! |

The winning quality of Anti:dote's afternoon tea is their beautiful designed sweets.
That being said, I prefer my desserts either balanced or unique tasting and there
wasn't really a single sweet pastry that stood out to me flavour-wise. Half of the
savouries were decent but the other half were pretty forgettable. If you wanna give
this afternoon tea a shot, do remember that the last day for you to try this menu
is 10 January 2023!
