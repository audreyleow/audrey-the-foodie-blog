excerpt: "Ever tried mod-Sin omakase before? This review was from my visit to Mustard Seed at the start of the year so the menu has changed since then! We went for the dinner menu and it was $178/pax. Our experience was a fun and delicious one! Definitely one of the better mod-sin meals you'll find and something I'd totally recommend!"

| 👌🏻𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐁𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐆𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐢𝐜 𝐒𝐚𝐮𝐜𝐞 | Loved the intenesly savoury and fragrant garlic sauce! The cucumber added a balancing refreshingness but the pork belly is on the dry side tho.                                                                     |
| 👌🏻𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐩                         | This soup was made from dashi and white miso. It was savoury, umami yet refreshing - wonderfully balanced! The egg fishcake was my favourite!                                                                       |
| 𝐒𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐢, 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐢 𝐬𝐚𝐮𝐜𝐞        | The squid was perfectly cooked, the chawanmushi was so silky and paired nicely with the umami porcini sauce! The ginku and chestnuts fillings were on the firmer side.                                              |
| ⭐𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐛 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐠𝐞                  | I loved the robust umami crab stock and that was complemented by the sweetness of the tomatoes and crab! What made me enjoy this was the crab-bisque-like nature of this dish!                                      |
| 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐨𝐭𝐮𝐬 𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐭, 𝐍𝐠𝐨𝐡 𝐇𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐠          | This was crispy and incredibly juicy - i enjoyed the sweet and savoury meat and prawn mixture as well as the crisp lotus root. This came with some sweet caramel-like sauce on the side but it was good on its own. |
| 𝐋𝐨𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐨 𝐅𝐚𝐧                         | The lobster was perfectly cooked while the broth had a nice clean seafood flavour . Personally I prefer a richer less filtered broth!                                                                               |
| ⭐𝐄𝐚𝐫𝐥 𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦, 𝐅𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞       | Absolutely loved how floral,sweet and creamy the earl grey ice cream was! Also really enjoyed the nutty and buttery florentine biscuits on top!                                                                     |
| 👌🏻𝐊𝐮𝐦𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐭 𝐒𝐮𝐠𝐞𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐤𝐞                    | The cake was tender, fragrant and moist! It came with some sweet dried orange peel ice cream, that had a light citrusy fragrance and milkiness that complemented the cake!                                          |
