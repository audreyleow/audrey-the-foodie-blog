These 𝐏𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐧 𝐖𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞𝐬 [$6] were chewy and fragrant! I also loved the seasonal decoration! We got their MSW gelato and pistachio gelato - MSW was fantastic, while the pistachio was earthy, with a strong toasted flavour that was a tad bit bitter and gritty.

If you’re a MSW lover, the MSW gelato in this 𝐌𝐒𝐖 𝐆𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐥 [$7.50] will be perfect for you! It was hardcore bittersweet goodness - top notch quality! A must order!
