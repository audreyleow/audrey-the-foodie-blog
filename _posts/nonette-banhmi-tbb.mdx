{excerpt} As you can see from the menu below, there are 3 types of banh mi to choose from and I wanted to get the Chef’s special - unfortunately it was sold out so I settled for their 𝐏𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐑𝐨𝐭𝐢 [$12].

Thankfully I wasn't disappointed! Every mouthful was a savoury flavour bomb. The soy and garlic roast chicken thigh was juicy, and the bread is slathered generously with garlic egg mayo that made every bite moreish. Not forgetting the crisp and refreshing slices of daikon and carrot pickles that made this bahn mi nicely balanced. The baguette while crispy, had an airiness that I seldom see in Singaporean banh mis.

𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
While the bahn mi was very good, it is pricey especially since this is half the size of the banh mi’s you can find in SG and twice the price. There’s a bit of miscommunication about whether the bahn mi was sold out for the day when in fact the second batch was alrdy on the way.
