{excerpt} Have you ever seen a big breakfast with THREE different kind of meats? This 𝐁𝐢𝐠 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝟐.𝟎 [$20.80] came with lamb sausage, beef kofta and beef bacon! My favourite was the lamb sausage which was crazy juicy and perfect if you like gamey meats! The beef bacon had a strong beefy flavour with some smokiness. The beef kofta was dry and tough but it was meaty and had a nice charred flavour. The scrambled eggs were creamy, savoury and milk-forward. The beans were sweet with some earthiness from capsicum.
