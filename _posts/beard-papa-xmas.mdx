{frontmatter.excerpt} I’m always excited to see the new monthly flavours that Beard Papa comes up with. This December it’s pistachio!! This 𝐏𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐨 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐏𝐮𝐟𝐟 [$3.80] was creamy and wonderfully nutty!

I also got their 𝐂𝐡𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐚𝐬 𝐖𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐏𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐬 [$4] that you can stuffed with a Cookie Butter custard! Sadly mine was half-filled 🥲 The cookie butter tasted exactly like lotus biscoff - good for those with a sweet tooth!
