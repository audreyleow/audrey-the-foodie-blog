{excerpt} but unfortunately that was missing. Thankfully this 👌🏼 𝐋𝐨𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐇𝐨𝐤𝐤𝐢𝐞𝐧 𝐌𝐞𝐞 more than made up with how flavourful and savoury it was. The juicy lime made the noodles savoury and moreish on a whole. The sweet sambal also packed a punch.

The inclusion of the lobster was gratuitous - it tasted fresh and juicy but did nothing to elevate the meal. I saw online that there’s a cheaper prawn alternative - unfortunately it’s only available at 1 out of the 2 stalls there, at the one near Wings of Time
