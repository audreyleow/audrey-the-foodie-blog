{frontmatter.excerpt} 𝐀𝐠𝐥𝐢𝐨 𝐎𝐥𝐢𝐨 [$5.50] and 𝐓𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐨 𝐒𝐚𝐮𝐜𝐞 [$6] pastas - the tomato sauce stood out with its sweetness and earthy spiciness of the chilli padi! I was stunned by the affordability of the premium toppings - you can choose from roasted garlic chicken, beef ribeye, prawns and smoked duck from just $2 - $3.50! The prawns were plump and juicy, while the sous vid chicken was tender with a lovely char. While the ribeye was a tad bit tough, it was well-seasoned, as was the tender smoky duck! Regular toppings such as mushrooms and spinach can be added for just $1!

<br />
They also offer side dishes for $4.50 if you wanna get your greens on! We tried their
𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐢 [$4.50] - the broccoli was nicely smoky while the garlic aioli added
some tanginess!

Thank you @pasta.play for the invite and lovely hospitality!
