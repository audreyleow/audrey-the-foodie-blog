{excerpt} 𝐀𝐠𝐥𝐢𝐨 𝐎𝐥𝐢𝐨 [$5.50] and 𝐓𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐨 𝐒𝐚𝐮𝐜𝐞 [$6] pastas - the tomato sauce stood out with its sweetness and earthy spiciness of the chilli padi! Check out their menu below!

I was stunned by the affordability of the premium toppings - you can choose from roasted garlic chicken, beef ribeye, prawns and smoked duck from just $2 - $3.50! The prawns were plump and juicy, while the sous vid chicken was tender with a lovely char. While the ribeye was a tad bit tough, it was well seasoned, as was the tender smoky duck! Regular toppings such as mushrooms and spinach can be added for just $1!

They also offer side dishes such as charred brussel sprouts and mixed mushrooms for
$4.50 if you wanna get your greens on! We tried their 𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐢 [$4.50] - the broccoli was nicely smoky while the garlic aioli added some tanginess!
