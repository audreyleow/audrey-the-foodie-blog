{excerpt} Of course, the key thing to know is that not all gelatos are made equal! Spotting a good gelato is pretty straightforward - high quality gelato will be dull in colour, and should not go beyond the height of the container that it's in. The ideal gelato will generally be stored in metal containers, and tend to melt quickly outside! We actually had to wait outside the shop for the gelato to be ready - even though they open at 9am, their gelato was only available after 10am! Yes, we ate gelato for breakfast but trust me there's no judgement from the locals there!ðŸ˜‰ As you can see below, the gelato at Gelateria da Constanza checks all the important things to look out for in a high quality gelato!

My favourite gelato flavours are always some varient of nuts and chocolate -  the quality is usually unbeatable! I got their <b>Coppetta Media 3 Gusti</b> [â‚¬3], and chose Pistachio, Hazelnut and Tiramisu! The tiramisu gelato had a lovely roasted coffee flavour with a nice milkiness, while the pistachio had a lovely nutty flavour, although the intensity could be improved! The star was definitely the hazelnut gelato, with its perfect creamy nuttiness!
