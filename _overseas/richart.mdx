{excerpt} A trip to Paris isn't complete without a taste of the French Macaron, and when I see so many people flock to the ever so popular Ladurée, I die a little inside HAHA. I'll share about my experience with Ladurée in another review but to sum it up, their macaron flavours are pretty average, one-dimensionally sweet and frankly underwhelming for their hype. If you are ever in Paris and craving a macaron, make it this one! We got 6 flavours to try for €12, <b>Speculos, Raspberry & Blackberry, Blueberry, Pistachio, Roasted Hazelnut</b> and <b>Salted Butter Caramel</b>.

My go-to dessert flavours in Europe have been pretty nut-centric; somehow they tend to be the best ones of the lot, with robust nuttiness and wonderful creaminess. And the Pistachio and Roasted Hazelnut macarons were no different. The pistachio macaron at RICHART is by far the BEST PISTACHIO-FLAVOURED DESSERT I HAVE EVER EATEN. I swear to you, I got hella emotional eating this heavenly macaron. Nothing will compare, I promise. If you prefer a less aggressive nut flavour, the roasted hazelnut is a perfect option for you, with its wonderful sweet nuttiness.

My only complaint about European sweet treats is regarding anything that's salted caramel flavoured - they generally tasted more like butterscotch instead of caramel. Once you accept that and adjust your tastebuds accordingly, you will find the Salted Butter Caramel macaron to have lovely roasted flavours, with an iconic milkiness that butterscotch flavours tend to have! 

Keeping with the caramelized vibe, is the Speculos macaron. Any Speculos flavoured pastry usually involves the simple use of cookie butter spread but not at Richart, that's not good enough! I was stunned by the fragrance of the spices used to achieve the iconic Speculos flavour, you can taste the effort and "made from scratch" nature of this macaron!

For those of you who enjoy a fruity dessert instead, their Raspberry & Blackberry and Blueberry macarons were exceptional! The first tasting exactly like raspberries, with its signature sweet-tartness represented perfectly, while the latter showcased the sweet recognisable earthiness of fresh blueberry skins; just wonderful!

If you are planning to make only one pastry stop in Paris (wtf why only one, are you crazy LMAO), please make it this one. Let RICHART blow your mind with how good macarons can be. Macarons aren't just overly sweet desserts - RICHART will show you how they can be executed to divine perfection. I rarely am rendered speechless by pastries nowadays, but these macarons were made with so much heart that they have done the impossible.
