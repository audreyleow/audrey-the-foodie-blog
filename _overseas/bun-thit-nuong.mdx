{excerpt} It may be an intimidating (and also not the most hygienic) experience, but choosing the right place to do so will make it worth the while!

This spot sells only 1 thing - Bún Thịt Nướng Thập Cẩm and boy do they it excellently. Look out for the “shop front” below and let them know how many bowls you will be ordering. They will then point you to your seat (don’t be surprised if they ask you to sit across the streets if it’s crowded!)

For 60K dong, you get a bowl of thick bee hoon topped generously with sliced pickled veggies, grilled pork and spring rolls. The grilled pork was wonderfully smoky and savoury but we felt that the star of the dish was the crispy, moreish spring rolls! I recommend adding the given chilli fish sauce to the plain noodles for a spicy savoury kick!

My only complaint is that the portion is on the smaller side -  they do mix in a lot of herbs so the noodles are about half the portion you'd get for other noodle dishes. If you are planning to pace yourself for a whole day of feasting, this is just the right portion!
