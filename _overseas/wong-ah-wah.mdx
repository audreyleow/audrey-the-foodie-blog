{excerpt} If you grew up eating BBQ chicken wings from the now-defunct Farmart (the shop moved to Taman Jurong), I'm glad to say that KL has its equivalent at Wong Ah Wah. These 𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 [RM4/pc] were smoky and tender - a must order!  Our other go-to is their 𝐆𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐢𝐜 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐊𝐚𝐧𝐠 𝐊𝐨𝐧𝐠 [RM15/small]; I recommend getting a bowl of rice to soak up the remaining savoury gravy at the bottom of the plate!

Wong Ah Wah is also known for their 𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐲𝐬 [RM1.60/stick] but I would advise skipping them. You can choose chicken, beef or mutton but they were all tough and the fatty parts of the satay weren't distributed properly - each stick consisted of 2 parts of tough lean meat, with a thick chewy piece of fat wedged between them. The only redeeming quality of these satays were their smokiness.

Their selection of fried noodles aren't anything to scream about but they are still quite decent. Their 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐊𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐓𝐞𝐨𝐰 [RM11/small] was smoky and well-seasoned but the rice flour flavour of the kway teow was pretty prominent.
