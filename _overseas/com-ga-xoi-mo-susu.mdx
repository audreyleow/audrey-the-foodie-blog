{excerpt} Its current location is a little hard to find, being down an alley. We went at night so there was a bit of apprehension. Nonetheless, you will soon see that it was well worth the journey! I was drawn to this chicken rice shop because of the unique way they prepare their chicken! By “raining” their oil down to fry their chicken, the end product is crispy chicken skin with tender, juicy meat! Here's a <a className="external-link" href={`https://www.google.com/maps/uv?pb=!1s0x31752f2595210a63%3A0xe8ea9b8fc7c3976c!3m1!7e115!5sGoogle%20Search!15sCgIgAQ&hl=en&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipNXwrJ22r61U3pyjfloBwOTiiHS4y7aVh6E-eG3&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX4_Ccjcj8AhUsxjgGHY9qBdYQ9fkHKAF6BAgBEG4`}> video</a> of how they do it! I've also included their menu below!

But the unexpected star of the meal was their rice - we did not expect the amount of wokhei that was present in this unassuming rice. It was like fried rice on steroids - oily, savoury and incredibly moreish. It was so good that the hubs ordered another portion of rice [10K]!

There’s also a thick homemade garlicky hoisin-based dipping sauce that admittedly looks sussy af but lemme tell you, looks are deceiving! It was soo good that we poured it on EVERYTHING. Mixing it with the rice somehow made the excellent rice, even better?!?
