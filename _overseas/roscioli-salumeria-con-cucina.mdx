If you are looking for an authentic Roman dining experience, Roscioli is where you must go! Most popular restaurants require a reservation in advance; we found that if you arrive before the peak dining times, you will easily get a table! We walked in early and even then, half the restaurant was filled! We started the meal with an 𝐀𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐥 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐳 [€10]; did you really visit Rome if you didn't try an Aperol Spritz? It may be pretty but we weren't fans of clove-forward, herbaceous flavours of this wine-based cocktail.

One of my top food goals in Italy was to finally try an authentic Carbonara - most of the times the ones you see in SG are made using cream rather than the simple combination of eggs and guanciale. And the 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐛𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐚[€15] served at Roscioli's was life-changing. This was the absolute star dish of the night! It was wonderfully creamy ever without being surfeiting. The meaty sinful flavours from the fat of the Guanciale permeated throughout this dish and crispy goodness. The emulsification of the egg yolks and guanciale fat created this thick sauce that was literally crack. A must order for any visit to Roscioli!

I find that even the best Cacio e Pepe in SG will leave you filling surfeited at the end. Thankfully that has never been the case when I was in Rome! We got their 𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐨 𝐞 𝐏𝐞𝐩𝐞 [€14] and the pasta was cooked perfectly aldente. While the Recorino Romano was nicely savoury and the 3 different peppers used were fragrant, it could do with a lot more of cheese and peppers. If you prefer your pasta on the lighter side, this would be good for you.

And of course, for the cheese haters (like my hubs), we got their 𝐋𝐚 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐚 𝐎 𝐀𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐚 [€15]. Big chunks of crispy guanciale that are oh so crispy, juicy and intensely savoury! While we loved the sweet campanian tomato sauce, it was missing the infusion of the fatty flavours from the guanciale that gave the Amatrciana from La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali the ultimate oomph of flavour

Three pastas down and we were absolutely stuffed, with no space for any meats or desserts. As we requested for the bill, we were surprised by a complimentary dessert of rich chocolate fondue with a side of biscuits. A perfect farewell to a hearty and savoury meal!
