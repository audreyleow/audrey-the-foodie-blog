{frontmatter.excerpt} Currywurst spots are a dime a dozen in Berlin and let me tell you, you CAN taste the difference between the chains and the individual shops. We ate currywursts everyday and this was by far the best one we had.

If you don't know what currywursts are, they are fried sausages topped with curry powder and doused with ketchup. You can choose either a sausage with or without skin! The lady at the counter told us that the latter was meant for old people without teeth ðŸ¤£ Oh and something we noticed was how the people around us were German locals!

We got 1 currywurst, and added a side of fries and caramelized onions (zwiebeln) - the fries were ok but the onions were a sweet complement to the savoury sausage! A hearty snack for a cold day!

Here's their menu and a picture of their shop entrance!
