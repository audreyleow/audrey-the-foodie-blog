{excerpt} I've read a lot of reviews about how crowded this VCR outlet gets; thankfully our hotel was nearby so we managed to pop in early in the morning and get our choice of seats! I recommend going upstairs for more scenic seating options!

This <b>French Toast</b> [RM19] was the main reason why I wanted to VCR and boy did it not disappoint! We loved the flavours of the enriched brioche, with a good caramelization. The cherry on top of this beautiful french toast was the amazing espresso no-churn ice cream - it was creamy without being too sweet, and showcased the lovely roasted flavours of coffee! The crumbles added some fun textural and sweetness, and I love the juxtaposing tartness of the raspberry compote!

Switching to something savoury - have you ever seen bolognese on a big breakfast plate?? That's what pushed me to get the <b>VCR Breakie</b> [RM28]. Unfortunately, the lamb bolognese was hella gamey. I also wished that they offered beef sausage option because the smoked english sausage was uncomfortably soft, with an ambiguous meat flavour while missing the snap you want from a good sausage. The scrambled eggs were curd-like but the issue we had were how strong the sulphur flavour was on them. Even the mushrooms were lacking a lot of fat, and had a strong earthiness with minimal seasoning. Give this a miss.

Lastly, this simple-looking burger. Despite my love for soft-shell crab, I rarely order it outside of a Japanese restaurant because of their small portions and exorbitant price but this <b>Soft Shell Crab Burger</b> [RM28] was excellent and worth every ringgit! The soft shell crab was not the crispiest but the star of this burger was the incredible homemade tartar sauce -  it was so wonderfully tangy and made every bite of this burger so moreish! Also, check out that perfect sunny side up!
