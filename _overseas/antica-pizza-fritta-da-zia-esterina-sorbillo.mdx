{excerpt} The queue is relentless but lemme tell you, at this price point and quality, it is 100% worth the wait! Every single pizza fritta is made fresh to order and fried to perfection - stuffed generously with pipping hot creamy ricotta and melted provola.

I got their 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐞 [€4.50] and it was wonderfully savoury with that iconic funky complexity that I love so much! The hubs got their 𝐂𝐢𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐢 [€4.50], which is essentially pressed fatty pork and it was rich, tasty and nicely satiating without being surfeiting!

Even though this was deep fried, we didn’t feel heavy after the meal at all. And despite the never-ending queue, the fried pizza dough didn’t have any stale oil flavour. Now is this the best pizza in Napoli, of course not. But does it taste good? Heck yes. And at half the price of an average pizza in Napoli (which is cheaper than Rome), it’s a darn affordable one!

Be warned that eating this will be a messy endeavour so remember to bring wet wipes. There’s something about biting into a hot crispy pizza that’s oh so comforting especially when you standing along the cold Italian seaside at night.
