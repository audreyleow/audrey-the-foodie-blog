I got a glass of <b>REN Matcha</b> [RM17] - it was nicely umami but predominantly creamy with a bit of nuttiness. If you have a buddy who doesn't enjoy the taste of matcha, rest assured that there are other beverage choices available! Hubs got a glass of <b>Momotaro</b> [RM15], which had a lovely lychee and peach fragrance, with some grassy notes from the matcha. The fruity flavours are way more prominent and the hubs finished this drink so fast!

What took my breath away was this beautiful <b>AJISAI Intense Matcha Tiramisu</b> [RM16]. I loved the gentle sweetness ad creamy umami layers of the tiramisu! The butteriness of the charcoal almond crust was quite enjoyable, particularly due to the detectable hint of salt! That being said, we felt like the matcha dusting was a bit of an overkill because of the way it clumped at the roof of our mouths.
