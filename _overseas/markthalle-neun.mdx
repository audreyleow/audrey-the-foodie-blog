{frontmatter.excerpt} We got their 𝐘𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐤𝐮 𝐁𝐞𝐞𝐟 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐨 [$8.90] - the beef had a lovely char, albeit on the drier side due to its lean nature! The portion of beef was generous and topped with a sweet teriyaki sauce! This also came with 3 original gyozas! They were as flavourful as chicken gyozas can get - reminded us of chicken siew mai!

We were intrigued by their unique 𝐓𝐨𝐦 𝐘𝐮𝐦 𝐊𝐮𝐧𝐠 𝐆𝐲𝐨𝐳𝐚 [$6.90] - the texture of the gyoza filling was mushy but we were still quite impressed with how aromstic and tangy the tom yum flavours were! We could taste the lemongrass fragrance and the filling also packed a good kick! The chilli lime vinaigrette was a good complement too!
