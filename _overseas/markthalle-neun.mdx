{frontmatter.excerpt} If you are ever in Berlin on a Thursday evening, you HAVE to drop by Markthalle Neun for their bustling Street Food Thursday that takes place from 5PM to 10PM! Here you get the chance to try authentic street foods from people all around the world!

I walked around twice before settling on Ceviche as my starter! It may not look like it but there were easily 20 THICC chunks of fish in here! The fish could have been fresher but on a whole, it was still tangy, refreshing, with a slight kick from the chilli.

Hubs doesn't eat raw fish so our next order was easily a Pork Belly Sandwich from Big Stuffs Smoked BBQ with a consistently long queue. While the pork belly was hella tender, the sandwich on a whole tasted pretty average.

We were still feeling adventurous so we got an Argentinian beef empanada! Sadly it was lackluster - the exterior casing was bordering on doughy biscuit while the fillings were just plain-tasting beef lacking any oomph. The saving grace was the sauce that was similar to a slightly sour pico de gallo.

We then settled on 1 final savoury main - we got a plate of Moroccan beef stew and couscous. While the beef was nicely tender and the portion of couscous was generous, we personally would not get this again!

I have always wanted to try Kaiserschmarrn so we ended the night with this Austrian dessert! It consists of shredded sweet pancakes, tossed with rum-soaked raisins, covered with powdered sugar and served with a fruit compote. This particular one came with applesauce and vanilla ice cream. The warm pancakes, sweet-tart applesauce and milky vanilla ice cream made for a comforting combination! Wonderful!
