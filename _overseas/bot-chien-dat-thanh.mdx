{excerpt} Instead of glutinous rice flour and white radish, this is made from rice flour alone! Check out their full menu below!

Unlike the Singapore variant, it’s much crispier yet more bland. That being said, upon carefully observing the locals around me, the way to eat this involves pouring the given sweet-savoury soy sauce over the carrot cake and enjoying it that way. It made a world of difference, and actually made the carrot cake more savoury and enjoyable. Rest assured that the sauce is pretty watered down so you don’t need to worry about the dish getting too salty.

The redeeming feature of this dish is definitely the crispy edges with a lovely wokhei. On a whole, this was an interesting food experience but we wouldn’t recommend taking a special trip down to try this though! That being said, if you would still like to visit this spot, here are some photos of the shop front!
