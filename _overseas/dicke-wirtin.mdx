{frontmatter.excerpt}

As with every European restaurant, you know you're gonna start the meal with a drink! I got myself a Berliner Weisse - it comes with a choice shot of woodruff or raspberry syrup. I picked the latter and it was smooth and so good! Hubs remarked that this was definitely a drink that you can drink nonstop!

I got their Königsberger Klopse, which is a classic German dish of meatballs in creamy caper sauce. The meatballs were tender and savoury, while the caper sauce was nicely tangy!

Hubs got their pork schnitzel that came with a side of freshly fried wedges! It was massive, well-seasoned and crispy!

While the restaurant was definitely cozy and quite packed, the service we experienced from our server was exceptional! I requested for onions on the side and despite his initial confusion, our server said "I promise to get you your onions". And boy did he deliver, he brought over a gravy boat worth of onions and not only was it delicious, it was FREE.
