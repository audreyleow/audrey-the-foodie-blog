{excerpt} Carette is one of the most iconic cafes in Paris to do so! We got their hot chocolate and it was rich but on the sweeter side. An add-on of cream on the side is a must to balance that sweet rich chocolate! On a whole, I still prefer Angelina's hot chocolate - it has more balance between the richness and bittersweetness. That being said, this was based off my experience in Angelina's Singapore outlet!

Their scrambled eggs were perfection - wonderfully buttery and creamy! I loved the addition of the ham - it made the eggs more savoury! Even the simple mushrooms were buttery and earthy! Unfortunately their Pain au chocolat was pretty mediocre - it wasn't buttery enough. Thankfully the chocolate was bittersweet and quite lovely. The set also came with lightly toasted slices of bread that were enjoyable with a side of butter and jam, as well as a refreshing glass of freshly squeezed orange juice!
