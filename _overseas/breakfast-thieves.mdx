{excerpt} Breakfast Thieves APW Bangsar is easily the most popular brunch spot at Bangsar - if you are visiting on a weekend, be prepared to join a queue and wait! The prices are considered on the higher side for KL but still half the price of brunch in SG! That being said, the hack we normally use to save money is to build-your-own-breakfast instead! That way you don't end up paying more for the ingredients you don't want!

We got their <b>Granny's French Affair </b> [RM31] because I love a good french toast. This was just fine. The fluffy brioche was fragrant on its own but not custardy enough. The apples were sweet while the fragrance of the cinammon was nice; the sweet tartness of the coulis and the sweet crunchy streussel made for a nice complement. Unfortunately the vanilla ice cream was pretty standard Wall's quality.

If you're a fellow mushroom lover like me, the <b>Gotti's Black Gold </b> [RM29] is a good option for you! The mushrooms was crispy and juicy, earthy yet well-seasoned! The sous vide eggs were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the garnish of fried kale - they were oily, crunchy and delish!

Lastly, you can't have brunch without some scrambled eggs so we got it as a side. Unfortunately I can't remember the exact price. Nonetheless, they were like a more moist version of McDonald's breakfast scrambled eggs!
