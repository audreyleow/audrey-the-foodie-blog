{excerpt} One of the top things I wanted to eat in Paris was a crêpe but I didn't actually plan on visting any specific Crêperie due to our tight schedule. But that led us to find this gem of a Crêperie stand, with a queue full of locals! There's just one guy managing the stand and he was hella chill despite the consistent queue! If sweet stuff isn’t your thing, they also have savoury options to choose from! Check out their full menu below!

I got their <b>Grand Marnier & Nutella</b> [€6.50] and boy, was it wonderful! The crêpe was tender, with just the right amount of nutella, and a generous splash of Grand Marnier! I loved the bitterness and orange notes that complemented the sweetness of the nutella perfectly. If you love alcoholic desserts, you will love this like I do!
