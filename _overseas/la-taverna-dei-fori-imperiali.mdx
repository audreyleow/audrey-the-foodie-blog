If you are looking for an authentic Roman meal, you have to visit La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali! This unassuming, family-run restaurant may be near Colosseum, but it's anything but touristy! We went on a pasta craze here and found the best Amatriciana we have ever eaten in Italy!

We started with the <b>Cacio e Pepe</b> [€13] - I loved how fragrant the black pepper was, and the funky intensity of the Pecorino Romano! The pasta itself was al dente and quite chewy! If you're concerned about the pasta being surfeiting, rest assured that you can polish this whole bowl off like me, no problem!

I've always wanted to try gnocchi in Italy so we got their <b>Gnocchi Ragu Bianco Di Vitello, Tartufo Nero</b> [€16] - potato gnocchi with white veal ragout and black truffle! The gnocchi was surprisingly tender and to be honest, we prefer the chewy texture of the cheap mass-produced flour-based gnocchi. The truffle war earthy and aromatic, while the veal added a satiating meatiness to the gnocchi!

Saving the best for last, the <b>Amatriciana</b> [€13] was absolutely incredible! The salty, meaty goodness of the guanciale permeated throught the tomato sauce, making for a heavenly bowl of pasta!
