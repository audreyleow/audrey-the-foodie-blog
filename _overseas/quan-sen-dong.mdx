{excerpt} located at Dong Xuan Center, Berlin‚Äôs largest Asian market! We aren‚Äôt exaggerating when we say that this unassuming meal was one of the best meals we have ever eaten!

We got their ‚≠êÔ∏èMi·∫øn X√†o Th·ªãt B√≤ [$12‚Ç¨] - which is fried glass noodles with beef, eggs and vegetables and it was INCREDIBLE. Aside from their massive portions and generous amounts of beef slices, every strand of noodle was crazy flavourful and full of wokhei. The hubs and I genuinely believe that this dish can blow most if not all fried noodle dishes in Singapore, out of the water.

And you can‚Äôt eat Vietnamese food without ordering Ph·ªü so we got ‚≠êÔ∏èPh·ªü b√≤ T√°i Ch√≠n [11‚Ç¨] , which is beef pho with medium blanched beef slices. The hubs and I are so used to adding fish sauce to any pho broth we get but this pho broth stood out by being so wonderfully savoury and moreish that no additional sauce or seasoning was needed ü§Ø Just excellent food altogether!

Step into this restaurant and you‚Äôll feel as though you stepped into an Asian home. Be warned that the servers can only converse in German and Vietnamese - I‚Äôve included the menu for you to translate in advance. Pointing and number gestures are all you need!
