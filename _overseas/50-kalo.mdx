{excerpt} We started with 50 Kaló's take on the Frittata di pasta, which originated in Naples! Frittata di pasta directly translates to a Pasta Omelette but what it actually is, is deep fried pasta mixed with béchamel sauce and stuffed with a delicious ham and pea filling! 50 Kaló's <b>Frittatina Di Bucatini</b> [€2.50] is made with Béchamel sauce, Provola smoked cheese, minced beef with green peas in tomato sauce. We loved how savoury and creamy this fried fritter was, with its crispy exterior, the savouriness of the minced beef and the perfectly cooked pasta!

One of the most iconic Napoli dishes you must try is Pizza Fritta (Deep Fried Pizza) - it can be served 2 ways, one being a calzone/empanada, stuffed with various ingredients, and the other being a regular pizza base. The Pizza Fritta at 50 Kaló serves it the latter way, and we got their <b>Montanara Rossa</b> [€8.50], topped with Casa Marrazzo tomato sauce, Parmesan DOP 24 months and basil. The fried pizza dough had a crispy exterior but was also crazy fluffy without being oily! I absolutely loved the sweet tanginess of the tomanto sauce, while the cheese and basil added a complementary milkiness and herbaceousness respectively. This pizza's toppings may be minimal but it was so freaking delicious!

Our go-to pizza anywhere has always been a Diavola so our main pizza of choice was their <b>Diavola Di Gioi</b> [€9.50], topped with Casa Marrazzo crushed peeled tomatoes, Mozzarella di Bufala cheese, Gioi’s artisanal spicy Salami and Irpinia Fam’s extra virgin olive oil. The herbaceousness and spice of the salami was exquisite, while the thin pizza dough had a lovely texture. Just like the pizaa fritta, I absolutely adored the tomato sauce. An excellent and fautless pizza!

We were blown away by the affordability, deliciousness and wonderfully hospitality we experienced at this Michelin guide joint! The servers were friendly and patient, plus there are English menus available! The key thing you need to know about dining out in Italy is how to do it without reservations - you should time your meals such that you avoid peak dining times. Meals in Italy are culturally a long affair so some popular restaurants mmight be reluctant to seat you if you don't have a reservation! We arrived around 7.15PM and were immediately seated (which is apparently very rare). We finished our meal an hour later and were stunned to see how crowded it was outside! On a whole, we would 100% recommend visiting 50 Kaló if you ever drop by Naples!
